#Project Proposal

HomeFree is a mapping application that attempts to make only righthand turns. HomeFree is similar 
to Waze because it provides mapped directions that are contstructed based on a specific element. In Waze,
the outside element is traffic. Using traffic data, Waze constructs intricate alternate routes to a destintation 
that avoids congested areas. They argue that although the route may be slower in theory, because of traffic on main routes
their routes are quicker. HomeFree similarly creates routes that at first glance aren't the quickest, but are
certainly safer and also allow drivers to make turns faster as they do not have to wait as much at traffic lights.

##Justification
HomeFree will not argue to be the fastest routing home, but it will certainly be able to claim itself as the safest. "53.1 percent of crossing-path crashes involve left turns, but only 5.7 percent involve right turns." Additionally, left hand turns slow traffic. The more people that use this application, the clearer traffic paths will be. Of course, left hand turns cannot be totally avoided, but minimizing them eliminates so many other factors.
