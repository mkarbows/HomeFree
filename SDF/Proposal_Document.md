#Project Proposal

HomeFree is a mapping application that attempts to make only righthand turns. It uses open source map data provided by [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=11/33.9425/-118.2331). HomeFree is similar 
to Waze because it provides mapped directions that are contstructed based on a specific element. In Waze,
the outside element is traffic. Using traffic data, Waze constructs intricate alternate routes to a destintation 
that avoids congested areas. They argue that although the route may be slower in theory, because of traffic on main routes
their routes are quicker. HomeFree similarly creates routes that at first glance aren't the quickest, but are
certainly safer and also allow drivers to make turns faster as they do not have to wait as much at traffic lights.


HomeFree will not argue to be the fastest routing home, but it will certainly be able to claim itself as the safest. "53.1 percent of crossing-path crashes involve left turns, but only 5.7 percent involve right turns." Additionally, left hand turns slow traffic. The more people that use this application, the clearer traffic paths will be. Of course, left hand turns cannot be totally avoided, but minimizing them eliminates so many other factors.

####Justification
Building this application will strengthen my web development skills and will also allow me to explore new fields. I will be using mainly javascript and will need my knowledge from algorithms and data structures. I will also be exploring Swift and d3. This project is the perfect level of difficult for me because it allows me to use previous skills as starting grounds while also giving me the opportunity to push farther and learn new concepts as I go. It does not overload me with learning too many new concepts so that I can truly succeed in a few. Lastly, this project is something that I have found in the past few weeks I am terribly interested in. As I am attempting to switch my project late, I have found myself researching the potential of this project far more than I have found myself working on my other idea, which shows my interest in this. I think this application has a very realistic utility for everyone while also being quite an innovative idea. I am excited to work on something that has the potential to make insurance rates go down.
